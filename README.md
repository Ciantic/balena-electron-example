# Minimal Balena Electron example

Tested with Raspberrypi 4, currently the balena's 64bit images does not support
x-server very nicely, but X-server works just as fine with raspberrypi3 images.

## How to test

Make sure you have balena image running in local mode, then run:

```
balena push 1.2.3.4
```

It should, when finished open up google.com.

I consider this as a demonstration and in the public domain.
